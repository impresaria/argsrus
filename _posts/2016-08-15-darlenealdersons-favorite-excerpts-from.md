<p><b>Favorite excerpts from Elliot’s notebook:</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. So now
 here comes a real freak idea. The bible’s kinda good. I mean, for a 
sci-fi tale. There’s some mad vengeance God takes out on people. Dude 
doesn’t like to get betrayed, and I’m down with that. The plagues and 
locust shit and that heathen woman Lot’s wife turning to salt - pretty 
fucking funny. Can’t deny he’s got a sense of humor. And a real flare 
for the drama. Gonna go to sleep now.</p>

<p>2. Obama is really hot</p>
<p>3.
 I’ve never had latkes before but decided to go out on a limb. Leon was 
impressed at my adventurous side. I’ll say it once and I’ll say it 
again. I’m a dude who likes a potato - serve it up any way.</p>
<p>
4. I just have to say one thing - I’m [happy?] to have Leon [with a box 
drawn around his name]. Wherever he comes from, he’s helping me keep 
sane.
