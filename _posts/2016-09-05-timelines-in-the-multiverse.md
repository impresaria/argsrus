Making sense of the timeline of Mr. Robot one of the most necessary steps to understanding WTF is happening with Elliot and the gang. Non-linear storytelling can be hard to follow, even with <em>reliable</em> narrators, and continuity errors only confuse the matter more. I personally get a real kick out of trying to figure it out.
<h1>Clues Chronological by airdate</h1>

Elliot says they have time since it’s only March 29. I’m pretty sure the rest of the episode takes place mostly over March 30, and they infiltrate Steel Mountain during episode 5 on March 31, 2015, a Tuesday.[/caption]

Elliot sobers up &amp; has his crazy hallucination.
