<blockquote><p><i>“So here comes a real freak idea. The bible’s kinda good. I mean for a sci-fi book. There’s some mad vengeance God takes out on people. Dude doesn’t like to get betrayed and I’m down with that. The plagues and locust shit and that heathen woman Lot’s wife turning to salt - pretty freaking funny. Can’t deny he’s got a sense of humor. And a real flare for the drama. Gonna go to sleep now.”</i></p></blockquote>
