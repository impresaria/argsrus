Other numbers and a few barcodes which are not easy to read can be found on Ray's pill bottles which also occurs in this same time sequence as the dialysis machine images described in a separate post. The rx number on the first prescription for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitagliptin" target="_blank">Sitagliptin</a> (for type-2 Diabetes) - is <strong>0654684651-21.  </strong>There is also a phone number on the bottle:<strong> (212) 555-0178.</strong>
