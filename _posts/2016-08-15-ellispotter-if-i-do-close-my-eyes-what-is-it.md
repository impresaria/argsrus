<blockquote><i><b>If I do close my eyes, what is it that I picture years from now? </b>Like Leon said, doesn’t one need to understand that before they’re ready to fight for their existence? How would my future fairy tale unfold? Will I finally connect with those I deeply care for? Will I reunite with old friends long gone? See the ones I love find true happiness? Maybe this future includes people I never dreamed of getting close to.  Even make amends with those I’ve unfairly wronged.  A future that’s not so lonely.  A future filled with friends and family.  You’d even be there.  A world I’ve always wanted… And you know what? <b>i would like very much to fight for it.</b></i></blockquote>
