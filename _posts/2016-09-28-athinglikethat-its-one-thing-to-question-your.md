<blockquote><small>It’s one thing to question your mind, it’s another to question your eyes and ears but then again isn’t it all the same? Our sense just mediocre inputs for our brain, sure we rely on them, trust they accurately portray the real world around us but what if the haunting truth is that they can’t. That what we perceive isn’t the real world at all, but just our mind’s best guess. That all we really have is a garbled reality, a fuzzy picture we will never really make out. </small></blockquote>
