At roughly 12:33 into <em>Kernel Panic</em>, Ray sits alone eating breakfast while hooked up to an <a href="http://www.nxstage.com/patients/system-one/" target="_blank">NxStage Dialysis System One</a> (and if you were wondering, it's specifically used to treat patients with END STAGE renal diseases.)

Here's a closeup of the control panel in two different frames:

<img class="alignnone wp-image-6201" src="http://alderson4.one/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Dialysis703-300x168.jpg" alt="dialysis703" width="380" height="213" /><img class="alignnone  wp-image-6204" src="http://alderson4.one/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Dialysis705-300x172.jpg" alt="dialysis705" width="378" height="217" />

As you can see, the panel has four displays, <span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>one green</strong></span> on top of <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">three red</span></strong>.
<strong><span style="color: #99cc00;">E.230</span></strong>
<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">5.0</span></strong>
<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">0.50.</span></strong>
<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">450.</span></strong>

Over the course of the scene, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">red LEDs <strong>do not change</strong></span> (granted, many shots of the panel exclude them), but the green alphanumeric display does.

here's a log of the changes in chronological order:
<pre><strong><span style="color: #99cc00;">E.230    </span></strong>
<strong><span style="color: #99cc00;">A.100    </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #99cc00;">   </span></strong>
<strong><span style="color: #99cc00;"> 99:59    </span></strong>
<strong><span style="color: #99cc00;">U.100</span></strong></pre>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-6202" src="http://alderson4.one/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Diallysis766-300x175.jpg" alt="diallysis766" width="386" height="225" /><img class="alignnone  wp-image-6205" src="http://alderson4.one/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Dialysis767-300x175.jpg" alt="dialysis767" width="387" height="226" />

It does appear that the 99:59 is related to time and not codes or amounts (in liters or ml) since it is the only one with a colon. I thought that E.230 might be an error code but the only manual of the machine I could find resulted in malware on my Mac before I opened it so lost interest.  Next I will look at playing with hex conversions of the various numbers. Note that the hex symbol in the top images are 'on' (small light).

In between the 4 dialysis machine images are a shot of Ray's pills which are the subject of a separate post.
