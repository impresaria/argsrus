Used to be you could trust in the story, villify the villains, and celebrate the heroes. You could believe in the guts and the glory ways… those were the better days. Where did those times go? When the shimmering sky turns cold and gray, searching for that spark of light, just close your eyes and say the words: Everything’s gonna be alright. Imagine a world gone insane. Picture yourself high above. Imagine yourself in a world numb with pain where the crazies believe in that twisted love. Deep in your heart, hope stays alive…stand up tall and surely you’ll survive. Imagine a world gone insane. Imagine a world gone insane. Let your mind just drift away… ♪♫</blockquote>
