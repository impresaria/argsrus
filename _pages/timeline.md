Non-linear storytelling can be hard to follow, even with <em>reliable</em> narrators, and continuity errors only confuse the matter more. I personally get a real kick out of trying to figure it out.
<h1>Season One</h1>
<h2>Pilot/Ep1 - depicts Feb 5-March 2, 2015</h2>
<h2>Episode 2 - depicts ~ March- Early April 2015</h2>
At the top of episode 2, Tyrell states that E Corp is changing storage/backup ops at the "end of the quarter." March 31.
<h2>Episode 3 - depicts April 2015</h2>
Elliot's Medical Records March 13, 2015; And he's drug tested on April, 20 and changes the records a few days after that.
<h2>Episode 4 - March 27-29</h2>
In episode 4, the fsociety gang discuss E Corp switching over their data storage on Wednesday, April 1, 2015. Elliot says they have time since it’s only March 29. I’m pretty sure the rest of the episode takes place mostly over March 30, and they infiltrate Steel Mountain during episode 5 on March 31, 2015, a Tuesday.

Elliot sobers up &amp; has his crazy hallucination.
<h2>Episode 5 - March 31st</h2>
Steel Mountain

Shayla's missing
<h2> Episode 6 - April 1st</h2>
Vera jail break on April 1, 2015
<h2>Episode 7 - May 1st</h2>
Elliot on Krista's couch the first few days of May.
<h2>Episode 8 - April 14?</h2>
<h2>Episode 9 - <strong>5/9</strong>/2015</h2>
Gideon's email suggests that it's June 9, but this might be a mistake because in the same episode...

Angela’s computer lists the date as May 9, 2015 in the same episode.
<h2>Episode 10 - May 12, 2015</h2>
Elliot awakes in the SUV on May 12, 2015 (ep 10)

(Boardwalk Fail video uploaded to <a href="https://vimeo.com/137378169">Vimeo</a> on Aug 26, 2015)
