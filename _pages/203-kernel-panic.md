How do I take off a mask when it
stops being a mask, when it's as
much a part of me as I am?

The FBI believes that I was behind
the hack.

EDWARD
Gideon's gonna rat you out.

GUNSHOT, PEOPLE SCREAMING.

ELLIOT (V.O.)

END TEASER

CUT TO:

2.03.1 EXT. CONEY ISLAND BOARDWALK - MORNING 2.03.1

SURF CRASHING, SEAGULLS SQUAWKING. BELL JINGLING. Ê

MOBLEY
All right, man, explain this to me
again. Why are you taking me to an
arcade?

ROMERO
Well, I'm trying to tell you, but
you don't listen. That's the
problem with your generation too
ADD to really take in this world.

MOBLEY
All right, all right, break it down
for me.

ROMERO
Well, to really get it, I got to
take you back to 1924. Husband-and
wife team, the Bedfords, opened up
a freak show/ dwarf sanctuary on
this land you're about to be at.

MOBLEY
Dwarf sanctuary?

ROMERO
Yeah, they called it the Bedford
Lilliputian a whole miniature city
scaled down for dwarf and midget
inhabitants. I mean, they also had
other freaks like lion-faced man,
limbless woman, shit like that. But
the dwarves were the big
moneymaker.
Suffice to say, the Bedfords were a
big hit lines around the corner,
the biggest attraction out here in
Coney Island. Then one year, rumor
has it, the husband wakes up one
Christmas morning, grabs a large
kitchen knife, slices his wife's
throat open, stabs his little kids
to death, then slits his own
wrists.

MOBLEY
Huh.

ROMERO
No motive was ever determined.

MOBLEY
God.

ROMERO
Cut to the 1960s. Woman named Mary
Meghan Fisher decided to buy up the
place, turned it into an old-school
arcade pinball machines, Skee-Ball,
the likes. Called it "Games Games
Games. Shit, a bit on the nose, if
you ask me, not to mention
repetitive, but at least it had
clarity. Mary Meghan even installed
a little bar so she could get drunk
with her friends and shoot pool at
night. And so she did, almost every
night till one time in '86, she got
so liquored up, she accidentally
fell off the barstool and landed
hard on the pool cue she was
holding.

MOBLEY
Oh.

ROMERO
Went right through her neck, clean.
Killed her right on the spot.

MOBLEY
What in the f are you telling me
this for, man?

DOOR CREAKS AND BANGS.

2.03.2 INT. F SOCIETY ARCADE - CONTINUOUS 2.03.2

ROMERO
Place remained dormant until 2000,
when Ned Bosham bought up the joint
under the name Fun Society
Amusement LLC. Ned wanted to reopen
it as a classic arcade. Now, why
anyone would want to start an
arcade in 2000 beats me, but Ned
Bosham had it in his mind that
that's what he wanted to do, and so
he did.

CLICKING AND CREAKING.

ROMERO (CONT'D)
About a year ago, his oldest son,
Harold, wanted to sell it, but Ned
wasn't down with that. So the
oldest son, Harold, being
simpleminded and needing money for
whatever simpleminded folks need
money for, decided Dad had to go.
So Harold stole his twin brother's
hunting rifle and shot Dad in the
face. Now, what Harold wasn't
counting on, considering he had
never fired a weapon before, was
the kickback. It kicked back so
hard, he tripped and fell out of
his dad's 20-story window. By the
time he hit the ground, his head
opened up like one of those
Gallagher watermelons. All this
commotion stirred awake his twin
brother, Clyde, who, as he told it
to me, was in his bedroom catching
some Zs when all this went down. By
the time he got his bearings, he
was immediately arrested for the
double homicide of his brother and
father, being the weapon was in his
name.

MOBLEY
And how do you know Clyde?

ROMERO
He was my cellmate. This place made
him crazy. He thinks it's cursed.

MOBLEY
(whispering)
Yeah. No shit, Sherlock.

ROMERO
Before I left the clink, he gave me
the keys to the joint and made me
swear to burn it down before it
caused any more ruckus. He swears
it's haunted believes it is the
nexus of all evil in the universe.

MOBLEY
You buy into any of this shit?

ROMERO
F no, man. I'm too broke to be
superstitious. In a way, all this
hocus-pocus keeps things clean for
whatever it is you need to do. The
public records are in limbo. People
down in county don't even want to
touch the place. I'm siphoning
electricity from the grid. As far
as anyone's concerned, it don't
exist. Now, on the market, this
joint would run you about 5 grand a
month, but since it's you, I'll
give it to your guy for half. Come
on, Mobley, don't give me that
look, man. You know how hard it is
for an ex-con to get a job. Money's
tight, especially with my mom's
cataracts. The bills are adding up.

MOBLEY
I'm not here to rent from you,
Romero. I want you to work with us.

ROMERO
Oh, hell no, man. I just got out. I
ain't trying to go back no time
soon.

MOBLEY
Just hear my guy out, okay? We need
a phreaker. Now, you know you're
the best in the game.

ROMERO
Don't try to sweet-talk me, motherf
er. I don't need you to tell me
who's the best in the game. I
invented the shit, okay?
Now, either you're renting, or I'm
finding somebody else, but I cannot
get mixed up in whatever it is
you're doing.

MOBLEY
Man, this is a chance to get back
at the system that stole six years
of your life. This is a game
changer, man.

ROMERO
Who's this guy, again?

MOBLEY
He's, uh he's a little weird. But,
uh, he's gonna love this place.
He's got a thing for Coney Island.
You'll like him. Actually, you'll
hate him. But he's a genius. Best
coder I've ever met. And he wants
to meet you.

ROMERO
How much? Aw, don't smile. I ain't
said yes yet. Money's gonna be the
deciding factor in all this, and
it's gonna need to be a whole lot
to bring me back in.

MOBLEY
That's the thing, man. In a way,
this pays everything.

ELLIOT (V.O.)

to what to do at this point, citing

ELLIOT
And where is that?

TYRELL
I don't think that's a good idea.

ELLIOT
You think someone's listening?

TYRELL
Don't tell me you're having second
thoughts. You don't want me to have
to worry about you.

ELLIOT
I need to know what's going on.

TYRELL
It's not safe. I wish it were. Oh,
how I wish. How I wish. I think
about you a lot, Elliot. I think
about that night when we became
gods.

ELLIOT
That night I want to know what
happened. Tell me what happened.

EDWARD
Like he said, it's not safe, not on
the phone.

ELLIOT
I'm not gonna let you make me a
prisoner of my own paranoia again.

EDWARD
If you're not paranoid, you need me
more than you think you do.

ELLIOT
We had a deal.

EDWARD
You wanted to talk to him. I
delivered. It's not my fault he's
loony tunes.

ELLIOT (V.O.)
He really expects me to believe
this? Did we really talk to the
most wanted man on the planet?

MR. ROBOT
Why the f are you asking them? You
heard him. You talked to him.

ELLIOT
I talk to you too.

EDWARD
(scoffs)
What do you want huh? We had a
deal. I delivered! What more do you
want?

ELLIOT
What I've always wanted: for the
panic to finally stop.

MR. ROBOT

ANGELA
Thank you, sir. I've been pretty
broken up about it.

PRICE
Second, this interview that you've
set up, it's all wrong. I want to
do Fox instead of Bloomberg. No
preinterview, and I want final
approval of all questions
beforehand.

ANGELA
I'm on it. Mr. Price? I think this
is a mistake. Frankly, Fox isn't
where we should be right now.
Bloomberg is where investors get
their business news, and if our
goal is to reassure them--

PRICE
Sit down.

Have you ever had dinner at

No. I haven't.

You've never had semifreddo until
you've had it there.

ANGELA
Okay.

PRICE
I'll arrange a car to pick you up.
Saturday, 8:00. And, uh, yes,
you're right. Bloomberg it's more

According to the police report,
there was no sign of a robbery.

MOBLEY
Someone was there with the sole
purpose of offing him.

DARLENE
You're jumping to conclusions.

MOBLEY
What about that Allsafe guy? That's
two murders in a row associated
with this hack.

DARLENE
They caught the guy. It was just
some wack-job. Besides, I don't
really care discussing this with
you, given how easily you forgot
about what we started.

TRENTON
What, because I don't care for
stupid high jinks like burning
money in the middle of a park?

DARLENE
That stupid high jinks is killing
public confidence in E Corp, which
is exactly what we need to be doing
right now.

MOBLEY
We might be getting executed by the
Dark Army, and this is what you'd
rather be discussing?

DARLENE
It's not the Dark Army. They don't
know Romero or the two of you. They
only communicate through me, and I
sure as shit didn't tell them
anything.

MOBLEY
You're not the only person they've
talked to.

DARLENE
He wouldn't do that.

MOBLEY
The state Elliot's in, we don't
know

DARLENE
Don't say what you're thinking.

MOBLEY
You don't want to listen to reason,
that's on you. But I'm taking off.
I'm not sticking around to be next.
I'm gonna stay with my buddy in
Arizona.

DARLENE
If they wanted us dead, we'd be
dead already. Besides, if you're
just gonna end up in Arizona, then
being dead isn't that much of a
downgrade.

MOBLEY
Ha-ha. Then what do you suggest we
do, then?

DARLENE
I'll talk to Elliot. I'll hit you
both when I get more info. Until
then, stop spazzing And be cool.

MOBLEY
(sighs)
I don't trust her or her crazy-ass
brother. You know he tried to pull
a gun on Romero?
Think about it, Trenton. They're
the only two that talked to the
Dark Army. Now they're trying to
tell us the Dark Army isn't
involved.

TRENTON
What are you saying?

I'm saying we just committed the
crime of the century, and they're
trying to cover their tracks. And
right now, we're the tracks.

other, you know? Case in point:
even though you've been paid
handsomely, the physical condition
you're in right now kind of cancels
that out. And I'd like to say
upfront I'm very sorry this
happened to you. The guys I deal

happen to think it's more
productive.

himself.

"Sir, I must ask you to leave."

And something snapped in me, and I
just popped him in the face. I saw

punching him and punching him. And
I hated him so much. He was Indian.

He starts to cry.

Okay, fine. Forget the one-offs.
How about the countless wars

afraid to believe the truth that
there is no order, there's no
power, that all religions are just
metastasizing mind worms meant to
divide us so it's easier to rule us

us. All we are to them are paying
fanboys of their poorly written sci

normally do, and started talking

was crazy. Moved on with the day.
Then the next day, I did it again
talked out loud and the next. And
then I realized who I was talking

I know the cops took all your
joints. I looked through your
files. I also know you have
arthritis and probably can't roll
'em yourself, so I'm guessing your
son did. I can help roll 'em for
you if you'd like. Used to do it

Why did you start writing that

I thought it was the right answer.

RAY
The right answer to what?

ELLIOT
Controlling my life.

RAY (SIGHS)
My wife well, she drove her car
that day. She did everything right.
She always wore her seat belt,
hands at 10:00 and 2:00. She was
the most perfect driver I'd ever
met. (LAUGHING) ÊIt was it was
annoying. She stayed in the lines.
Never went above or below the speed
limit. Stopped at traffic signs.
She followed every rule. And then
one day, none of that mattered.
Control is about as real as a one
legged unicorn taking a leak at the
end of a double rainbow. Then what
do we have? You know that bullshit
people say about how when you fall,
you got to get up? I reject that
shit, man. You know why? The whole
thing is a fall. It can't help but
be. A perpetual state of grasping
in the dark. It's not about getting
up. It's about stumbling, stumbling
in the right direction. It's the
only true way to move forward.
Whoever it is you wrote about in
your journal, do you still see him?
I can tell the person you're
writing about meant something to
you. Sometimes he takes over?
That's why you don't remember
things?

ELLIOT
I shouldn't have come. I don't want
to talk about this.

RAY
Yes, you do. 'Cause you're smart
enough to know that keeping this
inside isn't going to last. You
play chess? I've been looking for a
good adversary. Want to play?

ELLIOT (V.O.)
What do you think? Is Ray right?
Maybe it's not about avoiding the
crash. But it's about setting a
breakpoint to find the flaw in the
code, fix it, and carry on until we
hit the next flaw the quest to keep
going, to always fight for footing.
Maybe we're all just stumbling from
the right questions to the wrong
answers Or from the right answers
to the wrong questions. It doesn't
matter where you go or where you
come from, as long as you keep
stumbling. Maybe that's all it
takes. Maybe that's as good as it
gets.
