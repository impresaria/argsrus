Title: S 1 EP. 2.0 PART TWO - UNMASKED

(POP MUSIC PLAYING IN THE DISTANCE)

E CORP SECURITY BRUTE (O.C.)
Anything?

SCOTT KNOWLES
Nothing yet.

(Phil Collins' "Take Me Home" playing in distance)

SCOTT KNOWLES
Who is that? Who is that, that guy on the bike? He looks like he's coming straight toward me.

E CORP SECURITY BRUTE (O.C.)
Okay, he's closing in. We're coming.

SCOTT KNOWLES
No, wait. It's too risky.

E CORP SECURITY BRUTE (O.C.)
We need to fly in.

SCOTT KNOWLES
Wait.
(to messenger)
Are you from E Corp? - Who are you?

MESSENGER
Just making a delivery. Please sign here.

SCOTT
What is this?

E CORP SECURITY BRUTE (O.C.)
Someone grab the biker. Grab the biker.

SCOTT
No, no, no, they haven't picked up the money yet.

E CORP SECURITY BRUTE (O.C.)
Mr.Knowles, we don't recommend that. We should have our unit search it first. Sir, are you all right? Should we come in? Are you all right? Is that your phone?

F SOCIETY (O.C.)
You have ten seconds to do what it says, or every Bank of E system will be bricked.

E CORP SECURITY BRUTE (O.C.)
Sir, who was the caller? Mr. Knowles, what are you doing?

PHIL COLLINS
~NO I, I DON'T MIND OH I, I DON'T MIND NO I, I DON'T MIND SO TAKE, TAKE ME HOME 'CAUSE I DON'T REMEMBER TAKE, TAKE ME HOME 'CAUSE I DON'T REMEMBER TAKE, TAKE ME HOME 'CAUSE I DON'T REMEMBER TAKE, TAKE ME HOME OH, LORD WELL I'VE BEEN A PRISONER ALL MY LIFE AND I CAN SAY TO YOU BUT I DON'T REMEMBER TAKE, TAKE ME HOME 'CAUSE I DON'T REMEMBER TAKE, TAKE ME HOME 'CAUSE I DON'T REMEMBER TAKE, TAKE ME HOME 'CAUSE I DON'T REMEMBER TAKE, TAKE ME HOME 'CAUSE I DON'T REMEMBER TAKE, TAKE ME HOME 'CAUSE I DON'T REMEMBER TAKE, TAKE

CUT TO:

INT. WHITE HOUSE

USA
There's no way. We've already committed $900 billion. It would be irresponsible if the feds sent more.

USA 2
And we're not going to ask the government to pony up the cash.
How do you burn through that kind of money in 30 days anyway?

PRICE
You have something right right there.

USA
Finally you're seeing my point.

PRICE
No, no, on your face.

USA
The point is, Phillip, we've already given you our burst of cash on hand.
We can't give you any more.

PRICE
Well, we'll sell the T-bills to the Chinese, and that money in return will be used as a loan for our company. Look, the real recovery program is months from being done.
The public is hoarding cash. The housing market is grinding to a halt. The big three are on the verge of collapse.

USA
Everyone at the commission needs to see results within the next three weeks before we can do anything else.

PRICE
Look, rebuilding our database is the only solution to this problem.
This is not my opinion. These are the facts, ladies and gentlemen. Now, I've cooperated with you on every level. I even have the goddamn FBI working out of my offices. Janet, Mary, Jack, please.
Tell me you didn't ask me to fly down all the way to D.C. just so you could, what, hear yourselves complain?

USA
You've got to resign. We have no other options. The President can't go to Congress with a bailout right now.

PRICE
In the fallout of the Great Depression, FDR closed all the banks for a bank holiday, and then he reopened them in stages when they were reported to being sound. Later, historians discovered what we in this room now know, that those reports, they were mostly lies. Nevertheless, it worked. It worked because the public believed the government had everything under control. You see, that is the business model for this great nation of ours. Every business day when that market bell rings, we con people into believing in something, the American dream, family values. Could be freedom fries for all I care. It doesn't matter as long as the con works and people buy and sell whatever it is we want them to. If I resign, then any scrap of confidence the public is already clinging onto will be destroyed, and we all know a con doesn't work without the confidence. If this was the best idea you could come up with for a win, I shouldn't be the one resigning. I have to head back to New York. Let me know when you've locked up the votes, and wipe your goddamn mouth.

(DRAMATIC MUSIC)

CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL BEDROOM

(GASPS)

JOANNA
Well?

S&amp;M BOI
You moved.

JOANNA
And?

S&amp;M BOI
Now I'm gonna punish you.

CUT TO:

INT. BODEGA DELI - MORNING

(TENSE MUSIC)

DOM
Ah, you know, usual, coffee, black, turkey sandwich on whole wheat, lettuce, mayo, muenster cheese.

AHMED
Already working on it.

DOM
You always take good care of me, Ahmed.
How's the wife doing?

AHMED
She's good, she's good, thank you.

DOM
Oh, I haven't seen her in a while.
Where is she these days?

AHMED
Our daughter is sick.

DOM
Oh, that right? That's too bad. Now, which one is she again?

AHMED
Sally.

DOM
Sally, uh, the young one, right?

AHMED
Yeah.

DOM
Sally, such a pretty name. Now, is that traditionally an Iranian name, or--

LINE JERK
Come on, lady, I'm in a rush here.

DOM
Jesus H, all right. God, Calm down. Well, I guess I should pay up, Ahmed, before I get lynched over here.
(BOTH CHUCKLE) , am I right? Um and this?

CUT TO:

INT. FBI OFFICE

FBI
DiPierro, he's waiting for us.

DOM
Yup.

(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC)(INDISTINCT CHATTER)(BEEPING)(DOOR BUZZES)

ELLIOT (V.O.)
When you look closely at the seams between order and chaos, do you see the same things I see? The strain, the tears, the glimpses of truth hidden underneath. Why do they fight so desperately to mask what they are? Or is it that they become who they are when they put on the mask? Sometimes I wonder what you hide behind, my silent friend. What mask do you wear? Or are you just as afraid as the rest of them? Me? Am I afraid? Nah, man. I'm different.

CUT TO:

EXT. PARK BASKETBALL COURT - DAY

BALLER
Hey, dipshit, can't you see we need the ball? (TENSE MUSIC)

LEON
This ball?

BALLER
Yeah, that ball. What, you slow or something? What's up?

LEON
Nah, I ain't slow, bro.
Go get your own ball.

BALLER
Yo, man.

LEON
What?

BALLER
What's your problem, son?

LEON
What's your problem?

BALLER
You my problem.

LEON
You need to learn how to speak to people.

BALLER
Oh, you need to have respect, son.

RAY
I got it. Hey, I got it. We're all just here to have a good time, right? Yes, sir.

He sits.

RAY
Maxine's been acting a little off lately. She really perked up when she saw you. You a dog person?

ELLIOT
Used to have one.

RAY
Oh, yeah? What happened to it?

ELLIOT
Don't have her anymore.

RAY
Hmm. Elliot, right? I'm Ray. I've seen you here before. You must like the games, huh? They put Bradstreet in. He's good on the boards. Come on, boys. Look at these guys. What do you see? A lot of care and effort over what amounts to a pretty shitty game. What's Maxine see? A bunch of dumb animals, can't think past anything but getting a ball in a hoop. What do they want you to see? Badass homies ready to kill if you step to 'em. Question is which is the truth? Maybe all of 'em. Maybe none of 'em. Maybe truth don't even exist. Maybe what we think is all we got, which is why I'm a little jealous of Maxine over here, 'cause all she gives a shit about is eating and sleeping. Ain't that right, girl?

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

RAY
Not the loquacious type, I get it. Me, I talk all the time, but I guess you picked up on that.
It's cool though. Communication is good for my line of work. Takes a lot of it to run a good business. But unlike you, when it comes to computers, well, I get them about as much as Maxine here gets E. E. Cummings, so when I heard--

ELLIOT
Whatever you heard, it's not true. I don't do that anymore.

MR. ROBOT
Just tell him you'll help. Try it once, huh? Let that old feeling come back.

RAY
You know, this morning over breakfast my wife told me I'd make a friend today. Not many people to talk to around here except for these knuckleheads. It's cool if we continue talking?

ELLIOT
No, thanks.

RAY
Damn, man. That's some cold, brutal shit right there. I'ma have to go listen to some Adele on repeat when I get back home. Okay, I can take a hint. Come on, babe.

MR. ROBOT
How long you gonna keep us in this analog nightmare?

ELLIOT
As long as it takes. Without my weapon of choice, Mr. Robot is unplugged, powerless. He'll try to wear us down, but as long as we stick to the regimen, he can't take control no matter how much of an illusion he thinks this is.

CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL BEDROOM - LATER

TV
I mean, it's a disgrace, an absolutely disgrace police have not found this guy. Not only does all the evidence behind the Five/Nine attacks lead to him, but he is the leading suspect behind the Sharon Knowles murder. I've said it before. I'll say it again.
The misogynistic blind eye by law enforcement in this--

BRAVO
My problem, Stassi. I hit her for a (BLEEP) reason. She (BLEEP) my ex-boyfriend

S&amp;M BOI
Hey, "Vanderpump's" on. You want to watch?

JOANNA
Another time.

S&amp;M BOI
How was I that time? Did I do okay? I didn't hurt you too bad, right?

JOANNA
You're spoiling it again.

S&amp;M BOI
Do you want to go have a drink at the bar? You know, I know the guy who works here makes awesome mescal cocktails. We used to bartend together back at this place

JOANNA
We're not to be seen together, remember? That was our agreement.
(KNOCKING)

S&amp;M BOI
That's him, isn't it? Freaks me out. Can't he wait downstairs?

JOANNA
He's doing his job.

S&amp;M BOI
She's still in the tub.

SUTHERLAND
You said 2:00. It's 2:15.

JOANNA
Hand me a towel? Go. We can't leave together.

CUT TO:

INT. E CORP MARKETING OFFICES - ANGELA'S CUBICLE

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

PR TWAT
So unfair. She came out of nowhere a month ago. Sometimes I see her talking to herself. Oh, my gosh, you did too? So weird. Yeah, Melissa hates her too.

PHONE RINGS

PR TWAT
Shit, I got to take this. I'll call you back.

ANGELA
I'm telling you, it's non-negotiable.

PRESS (O.C.)
No one's going to let you take that question off the table. The money burning is a big part of why everyone wants the exclusive.

PR TWAT
Bloomberg, line two for you.

PRESS (O.C.)
Except for CNN, which you guys don't want--

ANGELA
I got to call you back. Hi, Foster.

FOSTER (O.C.)
I thought the deadline was noon.

ANGELA
It's noon now.

FOSTER (O.C.)
It's five past, Angela, and Ryder's agreeing to the questions. He's also giving us top of the hour and Kelly.

ANGELA
Price doesn't even like Kelly.
I'll budge on the time slot, but I can't on the question.

FOSTER (O.C.)
It's fair game.

ANGELA
Talk to the segment producer and call me back.

FOSTER (O.C.)
Angela, I already know the answer. You were supposed to make this happen five minutes ago--

ANGELA
Just call me back.

ANGELA
(to twat)
Call Markinson.

PR TWAT
We don't want CNBC, or Fox News, for that matter. I think you should let Melissa handle this.

(PHONE RINGING)

ANGELA
Done deal?

FOSTER (O.C.)
Not gonna happen. Scott Knowles burning $5. 9 million is on the table or not at all.

ANGELA
We're going with CNBC. They're sending a deal memo as we speak. You know I would rather go with you. You got to twist their arm.

FOSTER (O.C.)
Bullshit.

PR TWAT
Did you just hang up on Bloomberg? Are you trying to get fired?

ANGELA
Leave.

PR TWAT
Excuse me?

ANGELA
Leave.

PR TWAT
(SCOFFS) When Melissa finds out--

ANGELA
Get her. Go ahead and get her. Tell her whatever you want, but right now get out of my fucking cubicle.

(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) (PHONE RINGING)

FOSTER (O.C.)
Fine, we'll take it off, but we're talking about the bailout and Plouffe's suicide.

ANGELA
I can't do Plouffe.

FOSTER (O.C.)
Then we're walking for real. Segment producer is pissed that this is what--

ANGELA
The guy committed suicide on national TV.
It's out of respect for his family.
Trust me, I'm doing you a favor.
You don't want to ask about that.

FOSTER (O.C.)
Please, it's been a month.

ANGELA
One question, and I have to approve it.

She hangs up.

ANGELA
Hi, Melissa. Bloomberg TV agreed to all the points on the exclusive. Foster's sending you the deal memo. I need to get coffee before the staff meeting.

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (EXHALES SHARPLY)

ANTARA NAYAR
Sorry I'm late. Coming up to the city was just a nightmare. The tunnel was at a snail's pace. E-ZPass is down again. They're saying indefinitely this time, but I cannot take the train in this heat. It must have been in the 90s today. Okay, sorry. So?

ANGELA
I've decided to stay.

ANTARA NAYAR
We agreed to discuss this.

ANGELA
We have for several weeks now.

ANTARA NAYAR
Need I remind you I was against you taking Colby's job offer in the first place? And then even when you convinced me that we should wait to see where it would lead, we agreed it was only gonna be for a brief trial basis.

ANGELA
I think we were both clearly wrong about their motives.

ANTARA NAYAR
Oh, I think you are being naive.

ANGELA
And I don't think that we need to have these talks anymore.
I like my job, and I'm not quitting.
That's my decision.

ANTARA NAYAR
(EXHALES SHARPLY)
You never had any intention of leaving, did you? I know you think they're pulling something, but that's because you can't imagine anyone ever valuing me as a real asset, when the truth is--

ANGELA
I've done more for you and the lawsuit than you've ever done for me or yourself. I have value, and even though you don't see it, they do.

ANTARA NAYAR
They are barbarians in $10,000 suits, but I see your resolve. I know when to cut my losses.
A guy walks up to a woman at a bar. He flirts with her. He makes small talk, but the woman insists she isn't gonna go home with him.
Guy says, "What if I offer you $1 million to sleep with me?" The woman's never had a million dollars in her life. She stops and considers the offer very seriously. The guy changes his mind, says, "What if I change my offer to a dollar instead?" Woman is aghast.
"What kind of woman do you think I am?" Guy says, "We already figured that out. Now we're just negotiating.

GUY AT BAR
Are you alone?

Welcome to positive affirmations volume three, success and money.
You'll hear the affirmations repeated twice.
I will leave a space for you to either repeat mentally or out loud.
Please use this on a consistent basis to form new neural pathways.
Good luck.
I am confident.

ANGELA
I am confident.
I am confident.

TV
My confidence is powerful.

ANGELA
My confidence is powerful.

CUT TO:

INT. PARK BASKETBALL COURT

RAY
Come on, sit down. Maxine wanted to come over and say hi. She missed you. I think the damn dog might actually like you more than me.
See that smile? (CHUCKLES) Even though we're technically not friends, I told my wife we were, was too embarrassed to say otherwise. You know, you two would get along. She likes to ignore me too.

ELLIOT
Hey, man, I don't mean to be an asshole, but like I said before, I'm all good.

RAY
(LAUGHING)
Sorry, I actually don't know why I'm laughing. I though you made some joke I don't get, so I usually just fake laugh at those, but really, I'm confused. I thought we were on the same page.

ELLIOT
About what?

RAY
When we spoke last night.

ELLIOT
I don't know what you're talking about, man. I didn't see you last night.

RAY
You really don't remember. You feeling okay, chief?

ELLIOT
That's what the control, the regimen, the journal, my perfectly constructed loop, what this whole thing's been about.

(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC)

ELLIOT (V.O.)
Last night till this morning, while I was sleeping, I can't account for it, a gap in my consciousness, and somehow he What do they see when they see you coming? And this is why I'm different. Sometimes my mask takes over.
(to Mr. Robot)
Why did you talk to him?

MR. ROBOT
Because I'm gonna make you realize.

ELLIOT
What? What will you make me realize?

MR. ROBOT
That they see me.

TV
This time targeting the Bank of E network in an elaborate ransomware attack.
The malicious malware targeted the bank's computer servers and spread to multiple branches in North America, encrypting the data and rendering the systems unusable until a ransom was paid. This more militant variant of the hacker collective forced Scott Knowles, the CTO of E Corp, to burn $5.9 million in public view. Shortly thereafter pictures surfaced on social media under the name #OPdailyallowance. Now, this is considered a direct response to E Corp's unpopular program, which would lower their daily cash withdrawal allowances for customers to $50.

BARFLY
Some stunt, huh? Everybody's laughing it off as a dumb prank, but these guys know what they're doing. Who thought that hard cash would be this valuable right now? We're reliving Black Tuesday, the Great Depression. Warning lights were flashing. I mean, in the last two years the Army Corps of Engineers, the Energy Department, the State Department, and the Office of Personnel Management were all hacked. The government claimed they were boosting security, but what came of it? The same as 1929. Shit hit the fan. An act like this changes people, changes society.

GIDEON
I'm just having a drink.

BARFLY
I'm sorry, and I'm rambling like a fanatic. Is there something else you want to talk about? The beaches of Barbados, espresso on Rue Montmartre, sitting around a campfire in the Adirondacks?

GIDEON
I'm married.

BARFLY
I'm Brock and I know you're Gideon Goddard. I watch way too much news.

GIDEON
God. I can't believe I'm a tabloid sensation.

BROCK

More of a diehard fan. I got a smile. I'm on a roll.

When did he leave you?

GIDEON

What, was that on the news too?

BROCK

No, just your face. It's obvious why they use you as their patsy. You give off a very sympathetic and honest vibe. You're the perfect vessel for their lies.

GIDEON

Yeah, well, I don't I don't know what to say to that, but, uh I'll agree with you that it sure as hell feels like there's something bigger than me in control.

BROCK
Thank you.

GIDEON
For what?

BROCK
Tomorrow I'm gonna be a hero.

GIDEON
I'm sorry?

BROCK
You may just be a patsy, but you're an important one. In fact, I don't think I've ever met a bigger crisis actor than you before. This is for our country.
